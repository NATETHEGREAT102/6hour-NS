#1. Print "Hello World!"
print("Hello World")

#2. Create 3 variables that each randomly generate a number between 1 and 10, named A, B, and C.
a = random.randint(1, 10)
b = random.randint(1, 10)
c = random.randint(1, 10)
#3. Print A, B, and C on the same line.
print(a, b, c)
#4. Make an if statement that prints if variable A is greater than, less than, or equal to 5.
if a > 5 :
        print("A is greater than 5")
elif a == 5:
        print("A is equal to 5")
elif a < 5:

#5. Make an if statement that prints if variable B is between 3 and 7, or not.
if b > 3 :
        print("B is greater than 3")
elif b < 7:
        print("B is less than 7")
#6. Make an if statement that prints if variable C is even or odd.#
if c % 2 == 0:
        print("C is even")
else:

#7. Create a variable whose value is 3 + a randomly generated number between 1 and 20
d = 3 + random.randint(1, 20)

#8. Make an if statement that prints if the variable from #7 is greater than, less than, or equal to A + B + C.
if a + b + c > d :
    print("A + B + C is greater than D")
elif a + b + c < d :
